        <p class="title">INVENTORY MANAGEMENT</p>
        <p class="title1">About:</p>
        <p class="about">Inventory management refers to the process of ordering, storing, using, and 
            selling a company's inventory. This includes the management of raw materials, components, 
            and finished products, as well as warehousing and processing of such items.</p>
        <p class="about1">Effective inventory management enables businesses to balance the amount of inventory they have
             coming in and going out. The better a business controls its inventory, the more money it can save in business 
             operations.</p>

        <p class="about2">A business that has too much stock has overstock. Overstocked businesses have money tied
            up in inventory, limiting cash flow and potentially creating a budget deficit. This overstocked inventory, 
            which is also called dead stock, will often sit in storage, unable to be sold, and eat into a business's profit 
            margin.</p>
        <p class="about3">Globalization, technology and empowered consumers are changing the way businesses manage inventory.
             Supply chain operators will use technologies that provide significant insights into how supply chain performance 
             can be improved. Theyâ€™ll anticipate anomalies in logistics costs and performance before they occur and have
            insights into where automation can deliver significant scale advantages</p>
